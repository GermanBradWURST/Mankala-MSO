--== How to run ==--
Sadly, due to the project being incomplete, it cannot be executed yet. 
Due to the overambitious structure of our project we couldn't manage to finish it in time. 
Using LinkedLists and many design patterns, we put too much on the table for us too handle. 

--== Sources ==--
For the making of the CircularLinkedList we used the following link as a source:

--== P.S. ==--
We would much appreciate any feedback on how to go from here. Do we cut down on overcomplex sctructure, or do we double down on our idea?
